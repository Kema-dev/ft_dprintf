# ft_dprintf

## My 42 Lyon's ft_printf, but as a dprintf

This project is pretty straight forward: re-code libc's printf. I adapted my version of the project as a dprintf to suit other projects needs.

Full subject can be found [here](docs/) but might be an updated version of the one I made the project with.
